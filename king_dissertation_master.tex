\documentclass[oneside,phd,etd]{Dissertation}

% The VUPhys class is used to setup the dissertation. Here are the options to use:
%
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. However, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces single sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The VUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines
%

\Acknowledgments{
The people who have contributed and supported me during my education are an uncountable set.

My thanks must go out to my academic advisor Professor Robert A. Reed. He has been a source of encouragement, support, guidance, and sanity during the time I have spent at Vanderbilt. 
I would like to thank Professor Robert A. Weller for his good humor, enthusiasm, patience, and help over these many long years and especially during the the final few weeks.
I would like to thank Professor Ron D. Schrimpf for his guidance, encouragement, and the many discussions on a variety of topics.
I would like to thank Professor Marcus H. Mendenhall for working with me and helping me break down my most difficult problems.
I would like to thank Professor Richard F. Haglund for his set of very interesting lectures on the subjects of condensed matter and solid-state physics, which had me excited to learn at a very early hour.

Additional thanks go to Professor Lloyd W. Massengill for his good spirits and guidance on a variety of topics, Professor T. Daniel Loveless for his friendship, and Professor Daniel M. Fleetwood for being a source of guidance, support, and being willing to share his knowledge and intuition.
I would like to acknowledge the ISDE staff, which has been very helpful and supportive on many projects and collaborations.
  
To my friends from California, Tennessee, and everywhere in between, you have always been what anchors me.
On the occasion I have lost my perspective, you have all been there with a helping hand, encouragement, good company, and humor.
I consider myself to be a particularly fortunate man for knowing each of you.

To my family who came along with me on this journey.
Your love and unwavering faith helped me through the most difficult of times, I hope you know that. 
Thank you all.

Lastly, to my grandfather, Edward Gray.
Thank you for teaching me to be responsible, respectable, and a good man.
